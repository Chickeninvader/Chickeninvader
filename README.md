# Hey there! :wave::smiley:

I'm Khoa Vo! I'm a student brimming with passion for Reinforcement Learning, even while diving into the fascinating world of Computer Vision. (Fun fact: I'm also a mean guitar player! )

My journey began in Vietnam, where my love for technology first sparked. Now, based in Arizona, I'm an Undergraduate Assistant at LAB V2 at Arizona State University (ASU), actively contributing to cutting-edge projects and refining my skills.

**My current focus:**

- **Reinforcement Learning:** My true north, I'm eager to explore this field and unravel its potential to solve complex problems.
- **Computer Vision:** Currently engrossed in the world of images, I'm building custom models for tasks like face detection and recognition, utilizing frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. At LAB V2, I'm fine-tuning Vision Transformer models to categorize images with multiple labels, contributing to exciting research.

**My skillset:**

- **Programming Languages:** Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Ray
- **Deep Learning Architectures:** ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet
- **Object Detection & Recognition:** YOLOv3, YOLOv4
- **Logic Tensor Networks:** Experimenting with neuro-symbolic

**Check out my work:**

- **Face Detection & Recognition Projects:** https://github.com/Chickeninvader/image_recognition
- **LAB V2 Projects:** Explore the exciting work happening at LAB V2 through their website: https://github.com/lab-v2/metacognitive_error_detection_and_correction_v2

**Looking forward to:**

- Connecting with like-minded individuals passionate about AI and technology.
- Collaborating on cool projects and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
- Continuously learning and growing as a developer and researcher.

**Let's chat!** I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and feedback. Feel free to reach out!

**Oh, and did I mention I play a mean guitar? **

### Things that I'm currently working on:

- Reinforcement Learning Agent on cartpole

### Challenges on board:

I decided to focus myself on feeding more knowledge:books: to my brain. I set a couple of self-challenges in order to push myself more further.:running:

- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto)
