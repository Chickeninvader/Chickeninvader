# üëã Hello, I am Khoa Vo!

I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Arizona State University (ASU), passionate about **Robotics**, **Autonomous Systems**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. Originally from Vietnam, I am now based in Arizona, working on interdisciplinary research and hands-on projects at the intersection of machine learning, control systems, and computer vision.

## üî¨ Research and Project Highlights

### **Computer Vision**
- Developed face detection and recognition pipelines using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.
- At **LAB V2**, fine-tuned **Vision Transformer** models for multi-label classification.
  - Integrated explainable rules to correct model predictions, improving accuracy by ~5%.
- During an internship in Germany, built a binary classifier for **traffic accident detection** in videos.
  - Achieved **0.7 F1 score** and developed a protocol for collecting data in critical scenarios.

### **Robotics and Control**
- Contributing to the **Duckiebot** project using:
  - **Object detection**, **PID control**, and **imitation learning**.
  - Implemented both simulation and real-world testing to follow traffic rules autonomously.

### **Reinforcement Learning**
- Experimented with:
  - **Imitation Learning** (BC, BC-RNN)
  - **Offline RL** (TD3-BC, IQL)
- Applied these techniques to real-world robot lane-following tasks in the Duckiebot system.
